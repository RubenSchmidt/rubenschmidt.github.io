      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Ruben. I am interested in building products, software, and management.
I currently work as a team lead and software engineer at Spacemaker where we try to find better ways to design our cities.
Previously I have co-founded two companies: A traditional startup, Jobbr, a platform where you could undertake and post smaller jobs, and Korde, a consulting company that helped startups and established companies with business and software development.</description>
