      <description>I have decided to start writing. Why do you ask? Well, the main reason is that I want to summarize, structurize and share my learnings.
During my studies, I wrote tons of summaries. Everything I needed to remember I wrote down. I have found that I learn a lot better when I write things down and try to summarize what I just read, in a way that I can understand when coming back to it later.</description>
